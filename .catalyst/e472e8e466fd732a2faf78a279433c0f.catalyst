The site administration wants to launch their project as soon as possible, that&apos;s why they ask you to help. You&apos;re suggested to implement the prototype of site registration system. The system should work on the following principle. </p><p>Each time a new user wants to register, he sends to the system a request with his <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">name</span>. If such a <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">name</span> does not exist in the system database, it is inserted into the database, and the user gets the response <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">OK</span>, confirming the successful registration. If the <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">name</span> already exists in the system database, the system makes up a new user name, sends it to the user as a prompt and <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">also inserts the prompt into the database</span>. The new name is formed by the following rule. Numbers, starting with 1, are appended one after another to <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">name</span> (<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">name1</span>, <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">name2</span>, ...), among these numbers the least <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>i</i></span> is found so that <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">name</span><span class=\"tex-span\"><i>i</i></span> does not yet exist in the database.</p>","inSpecsHtml":"<div class=\"section-title\">Input</div><p>The first line contains number <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> (<span class=\"tex-span\">1&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;<i>n</i>&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;10<sup class=\"upper-index\">5</sup></span>).
