Participants are usually offered several problems during programming contests. Long before the start the friends decided that they will implement a problem if at least two of them are sure about the solution. Otherwise, the friends won&apos;t write the problem&apos;s solution.</p><p>This contest offers <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> problems to the participants. For each problem we know, which friend is sure about the solution. Help the friends find the number of problems for which they will write a solution.</p>","inSpecsHtml":"<div class=\"section-title\">Input</div><p>The first input line contains a single integer <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> (<span class=\"tex-span\">1&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;<i>n</i>&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;1000</span>) &#x2014; the number of problems in the contest. Then <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> lines contain three integers each, each integer is either <span class=\"tex-span\">0</span> or <span class=\"tex-span\">1</span>. If the first number in the line equals <span class=\"tex-span\">1</span>, then Petya is sure about the problem&apos;s solution, otherwise he isn&apos;t sure. The second number shows Vasya&apos;s view on the solution, the third number shows Tonya&apos;s view. The numbers on the lines are separated by spaces.</p>","outSpecsHtml":"<div class=\"section-title\">Output</div><p>Print a single integer &#x2014; the number of problems the friends will implement on the contest.</p>","noteHtml":"<div class=\"section-title\">Note</div><p>In the first sample Petya and Vasya are sure that they know how to solve the first problem and all three of them know how to solve the second problem.
